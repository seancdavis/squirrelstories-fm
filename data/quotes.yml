        the steelpan originated in Trinidad and Tobago, some of the band members decided
        to take a trip to the island. Mixing it up with the locals led to island weed,
        discovering mom's ashes, and a bomb-like device in an airport.

      description: Becky was in a steelpan band in her college days. Knowing that
        the steelpan originated in Trinidad and Tobago, some of the band members decided
        to take a trip to the island. Mixing it up with the locals led to island weed,
        discovering mom's ashes, and a bomb-like device in an airport.

        the steelpan originated in Trinidad and Tobago, some of the band members decided
        to take a trip to the island. Mixing it up with the locals led to island weed,
        discovering mom's ashes, and a bomb-like device in an airport.

      the other accidental.

    description: DÃ©jÃ  vu is such a unique feeling, isn't it? We can be absolutely
      certain we've been a place and done a thing when there's no real evidence to
      support it. In this episode we have two dÃ©jÃ  vu stories, one intentional and
      the other accidental.

      description: Becky was in a steelpan band in her college days. Knowing that
        the steelpan originated in Trinidad and Tobago, some of the band members decided
        to take a trip to the island. Mixing it up with the locals led to island weed,
        discovering mom's ashes, and a bomb-like device in an airport.
