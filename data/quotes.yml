    description: Déjà vu is such a unique feeling, isn't it? We can be absolutely
      certain we've been a place and done a thing when there's no real evidence to
      support it. In this episode we have two déjà vu stories, one intentional and
      the other accidental.

        the steelpan originated in Trinidad and Tobago, some of the band members decided
        to take a trip to the island. Mixing it up with the locals led to island weed,
        discovering mom's ashes, and a bomb-like device in an airport.

      description: Becky was in a steelpan band in her college days. Knowing that
        the steelpan originated in Trinidad and Tobago, some of the band members decided
        to take a trip to the island. Mixing it up with the locals led to island weed,
        discovering mom's ashes, and a bomb-like device in an airport.

        the steelpan originated in Trinidad and Tobago, some of the band members decided
        to take a trip to the island. Mixing it up with the locals led to island weed,
        discovering mom's ashes, and a bomb-like device in an airport.

    description: Déjà vu is such a unique feeling, isn't it? We can be absolutely
      certain we've been a place and done a thing when there's no real evidence to
      support it. In this episode we have two déjà vu stories, one intentional and
      the other accidental.

    description: Déjà vu is such a unique feeling, isn't it? We can be absolutely
      certain we've been a place and done a thing when there's no real evidence to
      support it. In this episode we have two déjà vu stories, one intentional and
      the other accidental.

    description: Déjà vu is such a unique feeling, isn't it? We can be absolutely
      certain we've been a place and done a thing when there's no real evidence to
      support it. In this episode we have two déjà vu stories, one intentional and
      the other accidental.
    show_notes: <p>The music shared in the episode was "From The Bridge" by <em>Nathan
      Singer</em> of <em><a href="http://whiskeyshambles.com/">The Whiskey Shambles</a></em>

      description: Becky was in a steelpan band in her college days. Knowing that
        the steelpan originated in Trinidad and Tobago, some of the band members decided
        to take a trip to the island. Mixing it up with the locals led to island weed,
        discovering mom's ashes, and a bomb-like device in an airport.

    description: Déjà vu is such a unique feeling, isn't it? We can be absolutely
      certain we've been a place and done a thing when there's no real evidence to
      support it. In this episode we have two déjà vu stories, one intentional and
      the other accidental.
