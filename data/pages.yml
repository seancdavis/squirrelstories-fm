#   body: "<p class=\"font-size-large text-center\">\r\n  So, you have that one embarrassing,
#     goofy, or totally strange story you\r\n  love to share at parties, do you? Fantastic!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p
#     class=\"font-size-large text-center\">\r\n  <strong>Here's how it works:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n
#     \ <li>\r\n    First, record your story! (See below for audio tips.)\r\n  </li>\r\n
#     \ <li>\r\n    Next, upload the file to a file-sharing service. For smaller files\r\n
#     \   (&lt;50MB), services like <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com\"\r\n    target=\"_blank\">Dropbox</a>
#     or <a href=\"https://drive.google.com\"\r\n    target=\"_blank\">Google Drive</a>
#     work well. For larger files, you can try a\r\n    service like <a href=\"https://wetransfer.com\"\r\n
#     \   target=\"_blank\">WeTransfer</a>, which lets you upload files up to 2GB for\r\n
#     \   free.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Once your file is uploaded, share a link
#     to the file with\r\n    sean@squirrelstories.fm. In that email, include your name,
#     email address,\r\n    story title, and a brief story description.\r\n  </li>\r\n
#     \ <li>\r\n    We'll have a listen to the story to see if it's a good fit for the\r\n
#     \   show.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    If it is a good fit, it may be published
#     as part of an audio episode\r\n    within a season, a bonus episode for our patrons,
#     or even a written\r\n    episode for our blog that doesn't exist yet.\r\n  </li>\r\n
#     \ <li>\r\n    Before we publish the story, we will send you an email asking you
#     to agree\r\n    to the <a href=\"/release-agreement\">release agreement</a>.\r\n
#     \ </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    We'll notify you once your story has been published.
#     (And if it is\r\n    only shared to patrons, we'll make sure you get a copy, too.)\r\n
#     \ </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"font-size-large text-center\">\r\n  <strong>Story
#     guidelines:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Your story should be
#     truthful to the extent you can remember. We're\r\n    here for entertainment,
#     but we're looking for true stories.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    By submitting
#     your story, you're submitting with it the <a\r\n    href=\"/release-agreement\">release
#     agreement</a>. So, you know, make\r\n    sure you're not breaking any laws by
#     telling this story.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    While we may make edits to the
#     audio, we're not in the censorship\r\n    business. If you want to censor names
#     or language, that's your\r\n    responsibility. However, we do offer that your
#     story be published\r\n    without your name attached, but we likely will not change
#     the sound of\r\n    your voice.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Be confident and have
#     fun. The best stories come out when our\r\n    storytellers are relaxed and having
#     a good time (sometimes this means\r\n    a little liquid courage).\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p
#     class=\"font-size-large text-center\">\r\n  <strong>Audio tips:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n
#     \ <li>\r\n    How and where you record is totally up to you. There is background\r\n
#     \   noise in almost all of our stories, and that's OK. We just need to\r\n    hear
#     the storyteller clearly and consistently.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    While you
#     can use any device to record (including your phone), we use\r\n    <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B003QKBVYK\"
#     target=\"_blank\">this\r\n    recorder</a> for ad hoc stories.\r\n  </li>\r\n
#     \ <li>\r\n    Any audio file format is acceptable. You're best to just leave the\r\n
#     \   file what it is by default after being exported from your phone or\r\n    audio
#     recorder.\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>"
