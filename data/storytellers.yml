          certain we've been a place and done a thing when there's no real evidence

          and the other accidental.

    description: We're getting stiff for the first of three consecutive episodes.
      We'll do that by dealing with all sorts of animals, along with a healthy dose
      of teenage awkwardness.

      by Andre Hinton, and produced by <a href="http://www.jesslamb.com/">Jess Lamb</a>
      and <a href="http://warrenharrison.org/">Warren Harrison</a>. You can find the
      song on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/76ZT6JoaZatpZUJRsmJevR">Spotify</a>

      description: Becky was in a steelpan band in her college days. Knowing that
        the steelpan originated in Trinidad and Tobago, some of the band members decided
        to take a trip to the island. Mixing it up with the locals led to island weed,
        discovering mom's ashes, and a bomb-like device in an airport.

          description: Becky was in a steelpan band in her college days. Knowing that
            the steelpan originated in Trinidad and Tobago, some of the band members
            decided to take a trip to the island. Mixing it up with the locals led
            to island weed, discovering mom's ashes, and a bomb-like device in an
            airport.

            the steelpan originated in Trinidad and Tobago, some of the band members

            to island weed, discovering mom's ashes, and a bomb-like device in an

            the steelpan originated in Trinidad and Tobago, some of the band members

            to island weed, discovering mom's ashes, and a bomb-like device in an

          description: Becky was in a steelpan band in her college days. Knowing that
            the steelpan originated in Trinidad and Tobago, some of the band members
            decided to take a trip to the island. Mixing it up with the locals led
            to island weed, discovering mom's ashes, and a bomb-like device in an
            airport.

          you claimed immunity prior to performing any of those acts.

        those experiences. Fears that probably will never come true. Derek is like
        most of us, except his fears came true.
